C4: Context, Containers, Components and Code

* C4 is used to document architecture

* Normally people will use the first two (Context and Containers), because they are of higher-level
    - The other two (Components and Code) are more lower level (more software level)


** (System) Context

* In the Context, we get the sense of the context our software is inserted at and who communicates with it.


** Containers

* Contains the systems our software has and their interaction.
    - This is a zoom in a specifc part of a context


** Components

* This is a zoom inside a container and we get to see what's inside this container


** Code

* Zoom inside a component

* We might get to see a class diagram, for example.

* Because the details change so much, we need to keep this level up to date a lot



* We also have here the concept of people, which something that will use our system (be it an actual person or another system).
